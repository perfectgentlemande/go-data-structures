# Some known data structures in Go

It's not that easy for me to solve leetcode so I decided to implement some complex (to me) data structures myself first.

Every structure is in its own package. Some structures based on another ones. 

## Data structures in this repo

- Linked list  
- Stack (based on linked list)  
- Queue (based on linked list)  
- Doubly linked list
- Deque (based on doubly linked list)
- Binary Tree (TODO with traversals)
